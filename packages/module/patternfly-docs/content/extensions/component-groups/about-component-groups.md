The **patternfly/react-component-groups** extension contains a range of React components that are more complex than basic PatternFly components, often combining and adjusting multiple base components to address common use cases. 

This extension replaces **RedHatInsights/frontend-components**. To migrate your product to this new implementation, you can refer to migration guide details in [the README in the React component groups repository](https://github.com/patternfly/react-component-groups#readme).
